# unit-4-game

In this game, you are presented with 4 crystals. Each crystal has a random value assigned to it at the start of the game. The object of the game is to exactly match the random number presented to you by the computer. 

If you figure out the exact combination of gems to click to match the computer's score, you win!

If you go over the computer's score, you lose!

You can continue to play unti you either win or lose.

After you win or lose, the game starts over.
